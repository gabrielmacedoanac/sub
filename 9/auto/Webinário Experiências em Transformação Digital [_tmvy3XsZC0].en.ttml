<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">program So there are already many doubts there</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">that can  m to be clarified directly is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">related to the digital</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">a process always under construction and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.300" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">always bring additional questions to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:44.940" style="s2">our communication channels here at</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.099" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">so in the implementation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.379" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">management solutions when we talk about digital transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">we generally think</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">of the direct gain of transforming paper into records</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">electronics but the digital transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">goes far beyond that the data collected</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">can be used for</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">maintenance management control stock of parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2">coordinate aircraft stop manage</p>

<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">imagine digital transformation reduces</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:45.299" style="s2">costs for the operator brings the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:48.360" style="s2">po  possibility of new business and most</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.299" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">importantly guarantees the decorability of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:22.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:17.160" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">in 2011 we started this process of</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.300" end="00:07:25.380" style="s2">2017 in 2017 an internal system was developed</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:28.560" style="s2">at Líder called helix to</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.140" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">be careful to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:17.220" style="s2">terms that we usually use,</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">trying to describe the s  iglas for you</p>

<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">of Agriculture that we always</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.980" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">more regulations that we comply with, but</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">these regulations are what we are going</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">to pay attention to. The digital operational report</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:52.920" style="s2">basically brought a big one.</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.920" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:54.500" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">our operation happens very far from</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">due to complying with these regulations,</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.940" end="00:39:06.839" style="s2">we had to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">very large amount of paper.</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.839" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:16.619" style="s2">to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.859" end="00:39:19.320" style="s2">operational reports that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.619" end="00:39:21.300" style="s2">generated for each application area, so</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.320" end="00:39:23.460" style="s2">each area had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.300" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">complete a document  printed form</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.460" end="00:39:28.440" style="s2">that was very complex to fill out</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:30.599" style="s2">because it had to meet the items of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.440" end="00:39:33.180" style="s2">the Ministry of Agriculture regulations</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.599" end="00:39:35.400" style="s2">for you to have And then we brought</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.180" end="00:39:38.579" style="s2">here some images of what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.400" end="00:39:40.619" style="s2">ended up generating in a harvest, right because</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.579" end="00:39:43.800" style="s2">we end up saying that the sector ends up</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.619" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">working by harvests, right? So this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.800" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">a number of harvest blocks that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:50.940" style="s2">we generated, we had to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">all this planning before the harvest</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.940" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">started because we couldn&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:40:00.900" style="s2">the risk of working without having the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">report block for the pilots to fill out,</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.900" end="00:40:06.420" style="s2">right?  for the pilots and for the executing technicians to</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">fill in and in the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.420" end="00:40:11.700" style="s2">image we have an average of reports that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:14.220" style="s2">were generated Every two months for only</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.700" end="00:40:17.099" style="s2">one client so we worked with</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.220" end="00:40:19.079" style="s2">the information Every 30 days because</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.099" end="00:40:22.200" style="s2">they work away from our</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.079" end="00:40:24.119" style="s2">office  and we depend on receiving</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.119" end="00:40:29.640" style="s2">touch the billing for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.420" end="00:40:32.280" style="s2">commercial management, we end up taking it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">there  from 7 to 15 days to receive</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.280" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">information, then another two or three</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">days to evaluate the information only to</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.940" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">took an average of 30 days for the information to</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:53.000" style="s2">be concluded and closed  all right, right?</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:55.619" style="s2">We even had a person</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.000" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">specifically from the company just to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.619" end="00:41:00.780" style="s2">receive the reports to confirm that they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:03.000" style="s2">filled out correctly because</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.780" end="00:41:06.980" style="s2">we were very concerned about how</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.000" end="00:41:11.700" style="s2">they filled it out in the field, right?</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.980" end="00:41:13.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:41:11.700" end="00:41:15.180" style="s2">quickly then</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.380" end="00:41:16.740" style="s2">he knows how to dig and fill it out again</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.180" end="00:41:19.140" style="s2">so we had to be very</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.740" end="00:41:21.420" style="s2">careful with all this information and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.140" end="00:41:24.420" style="s2">often redo something they</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.420" end="00:41:27.300" style="s2">had already done, right, it is worth reminding</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.420" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">you that each operational report is</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.300" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">generated by a pilot was usually</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:35.099" style="s2">accompanied by  more or less five</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:39.020" style="s2">pages more So we dealt with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.099" end="00:41:39.020" style="s2">lot of documents, okay, people,</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:45.480" style="s2">and we started to act  Finally, the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.540" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">more information that appeared, the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.480" end="00:41:49.980" style="s2">documents arrived, the more we</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">felt overwhelmed with documents, we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.980" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">what to do with them and sometimes it ended up</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:57.300" style="s2">taking a long time, as the team</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:59.460" style="s2">was already used to dealing with this</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.300" end="00:42:02.579" style="s2">amount of documents to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.460" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">analysis  we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.579" end="00:42:07.800" style="s2">feel that we were</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">wasting time, but we felt that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.800" end="00:42:13.140" style="s2">we could improve, right? And then</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:15.240" style="s2">we started to see the changes in</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.140" end="00:42:17.940" style="s2">other sectors as an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.240" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">us to change too, right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.940" end="00:42:21.660" style="s2">we did an</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.099" style="s2">internal survey at our company and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.660" end="00:42:25.800" style="s2">we realized that all our</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.099" end="00:42:29.160" style="s2">employees had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.800" end="00:42:30.500" style="s2">smartphone, right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.160" end="00:42:33.240" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:30.500" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:33.240" end="00:42:38.099" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:42.300" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:38.099" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">how to get 3G but today that has</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.300" end="00:42:48.420" style="s2">already changed we have the performance of 4 and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:50.040" style="s2">5g in most of the locations outside</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.420" end="00:42:51.839" style="s2">that when  we have to move</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.040" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">our team of pilots and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:56.339" style="s2">agricultural technicians to operate in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:58.740" style="s2">far away city, we have already started to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.339" end="00:43:02.460" style="s2">the hotels that received them already had</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.740" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">wi-fi, right? And as our operation is</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.460" end="00:43:07.619" style="s2">divided into planning that can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:10.440" style="s2">done can be filled in before the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.619" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">application And the rest during the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.440" end="00:43:15.420" style="s2">application we realized that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">could also make their lives easier</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.420" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">if they filled out the documents beforehand,</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:23.579" style="s2">right, we also started to notice</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:26.520" style="s2">that other sectors started to use and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.579" end="00:43:28.560" style="s2">accept digital documents  the great</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.520" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">example that we used internally, right</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.560" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">to bring everyone to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:37.740" style="s2">of ​​digitizing the digital operational report,</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">was the CNH, right that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.740" end="00:43:42.900" style="s2">renew it, it generates an application on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:45.180" style="s2">cell phone, it has a QR Code So if the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.900" end="00:43:47.880" style="s2">other bodies are using it, they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.180" end="00:43:50.760" style="s2">accepting digital documents why not</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.880" end="00:43:53.700" style="s2">try to digitize a document that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.760" end="00:43:55.800" style="s2">very important for our company, right? And</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.700" end="00:43:59.099" style="s2">then in 2020 we had the rea  The reality of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.800" end="00:44:01.740" style="s2">covid-19, which meant that a large part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.099" end="00:44:04.440" style="s2">our administrative team had to</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.740" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">work remotely, was another factor</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.440" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">that we realized that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:12.300" style="s2">work remotely in an active way,</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:14.040" style="s2">so you can be remote But you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.300" end="00:44:16.940" style="s2">doing your job, you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">this  data management and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.940" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">using digital certificates as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:24.180" style="s2">signature, we started to realize</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:26.339" style="s2">that customers were more adept at</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.180" end="00:44:28.920" style="s2">digital signatures, agencies</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.339" end="00:44:31.380" style="s2">were also starting to accept</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.920" end="00:44:34.200" style="s2">digitally signed documents, so we saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.380" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">an opportunity to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:38.940" style="s2">with the digitization of our  company even</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:40.859" style="s2">because the scene has a double</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.940" end="00:44:43.560" style="s2">approval, you know, we are approved for</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.859" end="00:44:46.200" style="s2">the rbac 137 which are the Aero</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.560" end="00:44:49.619" style="s2">agricultural operations and also approved for ribac</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.200" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">145 which is the maintenance today Sana does the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.619" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">maintenance of the aircraft itself so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:57.960" style="s2">was a lot of information for the  people</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">manage alone in a physical way,</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.960" end="00:45:03.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say now I&#39;m going to pass the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:06.540" style="s2">floor to my colleague  Leandro, who</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.420" end="00:45:09.000" style="s2">was a more operational person, he will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.540" end="00:45:10.680" style="s2">able to explain to you more about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.000" end="00:45:13.339" style="s2">development of our database</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.680" end="00:45:13.339" style="s2">and the system.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.800" end="00:45:19.500" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:15.619" end="00:45:21.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:19.500" end="00:45:23.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:21.480" end="00:45:26.819" style="s2">to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.880" end="00:45:30.420" style="s2">do all this management, we got as</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.819" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2">far as starting The project of making a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.420" end="00:45:34.440" style="s2">company&#39;s own system, but over</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:36.180" style="s2">time it became sent Even</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.440" end="00:45:38.040" style="s2">because we wanted a system that covered the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">whole company, from the financial</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.040" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">part, to the CTM, supplies and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:47.160" style="s2">operational part  of the report So after</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:49.500" style="s2">that we found this cavoque theme</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.160" end="00:45:53.160" style="s2">that in this case we saw that it had a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.500" end="00:45:55.319" style="s2">good base, the information talked to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.160" end="00:45:58.220" style="s2">each other and we saw the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.319" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">of making the entire operational report through the system</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.220" end="00:46:03.540" style="s2">also digital it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">is a report  which had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.540" end="00:46:07.640" style="s2">information, so we needed a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:10.740" style="s2">system that already had</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.640" end="00:46:14.280" style="s2">a good connection between the parties,</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.740" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">so through the system  theme cavoque we</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.280" end="00:46:21.660" style="s2">managed, right, over</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:24.540" style="s2">a little over a year, right to do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.660" end="00:46:26.460" style="s2">migration, the first part that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.540" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">financial, part of supplies, that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.460" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">&#39;s already calmer because we already had</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:33.240" style="s2">a system that managed this part, but</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.540" end="00:46:36.119" style="s2">the  the biggest challenge really was the issue</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.240" end="00:46:38.280" style="s2">of the operational report because we</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.119" end="00:46:40.680" style="s2">had to make the system so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.280" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">practical that it could meet</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.680" end="00:46:45.000" style="s2">both the younger and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">more senior staff that we have in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.000" end="00:46:49.700" style="s2">company So if we made the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">system  that it was difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.700" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">fill out that it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:57.900" style="s2">take up more time than the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:01.859" style="s2">physical report already took maybe it wouldn&#39;t work out</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.900" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">right then talking to the team right</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.859" end="00:47:06.599" style="s2">we getting the idea of ​​everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:09.060" style="s2">experience that our team had</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.599" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">we managed to make this report it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.060" end="00:47:14.220" style="s2">more or  at least three months working with</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:16.260" style="s2">the two reports, both digital and physical,</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.220" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">to have that confidence that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.260" end="00:47:22.440" style="s2">none of this data was going to be lost throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">process, right and Atra  As a result, we</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.440" end="00:47:27.900" style="s2">even presented it to the Ministry</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">of Agriculture, which attested to how the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.900" end="00:47:32.579" style="s2">information is ingested in there,</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">which does not lack anything that already had a</p>

<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:41.099" style="s2">today is even better, right in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.000" end="00:47:42.960" style="s2">terms of filling out that  as well as</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.099" end="00:47:44.940" style="s2">other reports, many fields that were</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.480" end="00:48:31.020" style="s2">Continuing here basically with our</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.140" end="00:48:33.660" style="s2">new work reality, we</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.020" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">managed to collate  put it here on this chart,</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.660" end="00:48:41.579" style="s2">so we After these 15 months</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.099" end="00:48:48.300" style="s2">was within the parameters, we</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.859" end="00:48:50.819" style="s2">brought this data, right, for people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.300" end="00:48:52.700" style="s2">see how much the gain was, right today the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.819" end="00:48:58.020" style="s2">we can see how much</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.700" end="00:49:00.540" style="s2">time we wasted generating paper and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.020" end="00:49:03.420" style="s2">managing these papers,</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.540" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">so today we can say that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.420" end="00:49:09.900" style="s2">the rework is over because in a launch</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:11.579" style="s2">you serve five sectors of the company, right?</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.900" end="00:49:13.740" style="s2">I put it down here and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.579" end="00:49:16.920" style="s2">managed to integrate  five jobs in one</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.740" end="00:49:19.260" style="s2">because the pilot makes the launch and this</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.920" end="00:49:21.540" style="s2">information automatically goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.260" end="00:49:23.700" style="s2">commercial that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.540" end="00:49:25.859" style="s2">operation is over to pass it on to the customer for</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:33.660" style="s2">information the operational because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.560" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">pilot it  do you have access to the income of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.660" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">his area if he had an income in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">agreement or if there was something left</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">unfilled, right, the part of management of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:44.460" style="s2">operational safety that is required by</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:46.859" style="s2">rbac 137 which says that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.460" end="00:49:49.260" style="s2">evaluate our runways, right because they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.859" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">specific runways for this type of flight</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.260" end="00:49:55.740" style="s2">they only have access to the information</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:58.380" style="s2">of the Runways they can fly So it</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.740" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">also shows which runway he is flying  and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.380" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">the Ministry of Agriculture, because in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:05.280" style="s2">past we had to compile</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:07.380" style="s2">all this information to send it to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.280" end="00:50:10.440" style="s2">the Ministry of Agriculture and today, as soon</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.380" end="00:50:12.060" style="s2">as they release the information, the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.440" end="00:50:13.619" style="s2">system automatically starts making a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.060" end="00:50:17.099" style="s2">report that we have to send</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.619" end="00:50:19.859" style="s2">to the map, right?  Currently, our</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.099" end="00:50:22.560" style="s2">team is much more focused on analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.859" end="00:50:24.300" style="s2">data, capital Nogueira said,</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.560" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">we can measure what we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.300" end="00:50:29.099" style="s2">doing and I think this was the great</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:32.579" style="s2">gain that we had, as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.099" end="00:50:36.599" style="s2">up front, right before the cavoque is  this</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.579" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">red line, we used to take up to 20</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.599" end="00:50:40.440" style="s2">days for the information to arrive at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:45.060" style="s2">office, so we put there,</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.440" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">like, 20 to 30 days to do it  the management</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.060" end="00:50:49.800" style="s2">of this data right and currently we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:52.920" style="s2">the information at the time because as soon as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.800" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">pilot launches the company already has access to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.920" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">all this information and to finish,</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:01.380" style="s2">we would like to show</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.240" end="00:51:34.099" style="s2">We were even commenting It found it</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.980" end="00:51:37.700" style="s2">very similar  with which Captain Nogueira</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.099" end="00:51:40.200" style="s2">shared the logbook,</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.700" end="00:51:42.540" style="s2">all the information here is in</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.200" end="00:51:44.280" style="s2">accordance with the Ministry of Agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.540" end="00:51:46.980" style="s2">as we commented with you at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.280" end="00:51:49.260" style="s2">beginning, each document of this needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.980" end="00:51:51.480" style="s2">several other documents together, right</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.260" end="00:51:54.359" style="s2">agronomic prescription map of the application</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.480" end="00:51:57.960" style="s2">that comes  of specific equipment on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.359" end="00:52:02.520" style="s2">aircraft So today we have access to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.960" end="00:52:04.680" style="s2">everything with just one click  ueh And also the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.520" end="00:52:07.500" style="s2">signature because the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.680" end="00:52:09.300" style="s2">customer&#39;s encryption and all the other information from</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.500" end="00:52:12.780" style="s2">each sector of the company so here we</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.300" end="00:52:15.780" style="s2">did a simulation this information here is</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.780" end="00:52:19.260" style="s2">for the financial sector right the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.780" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">commercial information so linked</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.260" end="00:52:23.099" style="s2">more here at the top than</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:26.220" style="s2">usually  there&#39;s the customer code,</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.099" end="00:52:28.859" style="s2">so we managed to reach this</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.220" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">common denominator by building a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.859" end="00:52:36.540" style="s2">robust database to improve, let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:38.220" style="s2">say, the lives of our employees</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.540" end="00:52:41.660" style="s2">so that everyone can analyze</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.540" end="00:53:36.900" style="s2">see the evolution that we went through</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.780" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">in the 90s in the 90s, where there was</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.900" end="00:53:41.720" style="s2">still a micro manual file, it was that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:44.520" style="s2">little machine and you printed it on</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.720" end="00:53:46.859" style="s2">thermal paper there and Look how we evolved, you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.520" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">know, and we went there through companies</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.859" end="00:53:53.880" style="s2">like Vasco VASP Via Brasil  and I passed to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.940" end="00:53:56.460" style="s2">ox at the time of technical representatives</p>

<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:19.500" style="s2">our story begins one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:21.900" style="s2">headaches we had at GOL is</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.420" end="00:55:45.660" style="s2">you end up having to redo this</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.660" end="00:55:49.020" style="s2">maintenance sometimes a maintenance package sometimes maintenance on</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.339" end="00:55:50.280" style="s2">my component So this is  one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.020" end="00:55:52.859" style="s2">big headaches that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.280" end="00:55:54.599" style="s2">wanted to solve here at the beginning and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.859" end="00:55:56.220" style="s2">had two phases So the first phase</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.599" end="00:55:59.880" style="s2">was exactly to solve this first</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.220" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">problem that is the protection of the documentation,</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.880" end="00:56:07.880" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:12.059" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.880" end="00:56:13.800" style="s2">do a document search at the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.059" end="00:56:16.800" style="s2">audit to send a sheet today?</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.800" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="00:56:25.740" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">hence this system,</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.339" end="00:56:34.859" style="s2">you index it automatically You have</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:37.619" style="s2">a page and it indexes by</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.859" end="00:56:41.700" style="s2">aircraft by date by type of maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.619" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">or flexible package So imagine what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.700" end="00:56:46.500" style="s2">technician is doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:46.500" end="00:56:51.780" style="s2">When he scans the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:54.480" style="s2">system he reads that alpha check he</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.780" end="00:56:57.660" style="s2">knows the aircraft he knows the date and he</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:59.400" style="s2">puts it in the right folder inside his</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.660" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">computer there in the cloud in the  true, right,</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.400" end="00:57:04.020" style="s2">so that document is extremely protected</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:09.180" style="s2">and then imagine now that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.020" end="00:57:12.440" style="s2">make this a free network and you search</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.180" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">for a component for an HP document, right?</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.440" end="00:57:17.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:20.819" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:57:17.700" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">made in the cloud</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.819" end="00:57:25.740" style="s2">in these millions of documents if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.040" end="00:57:28.260" style="s2">look for a combination of a Paty Number</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.740" end="00:57:31.559" style="s2">as nander would look like in a few seconds</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.260" end="00:57:33.319" style="s2">it will find all the documents in a few</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.559" end="00:57:36.359" style="s2">seconds in these millions the documents</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.319" end="00:57:38.220" style="s2">where they appear on the same page as he</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.359" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">partin Number and that serial no she</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.220" end="00:57:44.220" style="s2">amazing thing  now even the lesor</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">now doesn&#39;t even need to come here to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.220" end="00:57:49.380" style="s2">audit this documentation he&#39;s there in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:52.920" style="s2">Ireland in the United States sitting down we</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.380" end="00:57:55.020" style="s2">give him access  it&#39;s on the system,</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.920" end="00:57:56.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a specific page for him that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.020" end="00:58:00.359" style="s2">he&#39;ll only see the documentation for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.579" end="00:58:03.300" style="s2">aircraft and the system creates an</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.359" end="00:58:05.000" style="s2">approval flow Look how cool So it</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.300" end="00:58:08.700" style="s2">starts there today</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.000" end="00:58:11.339" style="s2">our technician performs the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.700" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">maintenance package these tasks are scanned</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.339" end="00:58:15.540" style="s2">and go automatically  for folder</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:17.819" style="s2">creates an approval flow in our</p>

<p begin="00:58:17.819" end="00:58:22.440" style="s2">inside the computer already document by</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.099" end="00:58:25.140" style="s2">document and gives a blue green then it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.440" end="00:58:27.420" style="s2">archived when lesoro will see we</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.420" end="00:58:31.859" style="s2">approval flow he will check all this</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.880" end="00:58:33.960" style="s2">documentation and it will give an ok or not for</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.859" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">that document then let&#39;s assume that he</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.960" end="00:58:38.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t like a document he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:41.400" style="s2">he has a doubt there he puts</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.460" end="00:58:43.859" style="s2">a red ball and goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.400" end="00:58:46.859" style="s2">our quality team now we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.859" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">to have a team  here separated with a reader</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.859" end="00:58:52.440" style="s2">here all day seeing</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:55.920" style="s2">document box boxes he looks at the digital and today</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.440" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">most The vast majority of readers</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.920" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">are already accepting the  all</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:03.839" style="s2">digital documents no longer needing to be protected</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:06.119" style="s2">by paper, okay? And this process we</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.839" end="00:59:09.059" style="s2">have also been doing in our audits,</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.119" end="00:59:12.059" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.059" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:12.059" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:21.900" style="s2">CTM gain from</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:25.559" style="s2">the CTN quality team, we</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.900" end="00:59:27.000" style="s2">managed to reduce by up to 30% the Our people</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.559" end="00:59:30.540" style="s2">did not reduce because we</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.000" end="00:59:32.460" style="s2">reallocated this team to do the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.540" end="00:59:34.740" style="s2">free part which is more complex the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.460" end="00:59:36.920" style="s2">preparation of the aircraft as a whole and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.740" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">documentation for  people see and look for it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.920" end="00:59:41.819" style="s2">and at the end of the day we solve not only</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">the problem of duplicating maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.819" end="00:59:47.700" style="s2">on the free network but also we make the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:50.579" style="s2">process much smaller so the aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.700" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">spends less time on the ground to do a free one,</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.579" end="00:59:58.980" style="s2">imagining here that in the  average</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="01:00:00.780" style="s2">20 costs 10 thousand dollars per day of lizem</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.980" end="01:00:02.579" style="s2">so you pass the account here if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.780" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">manage to earn three four five days</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.579" end="01:00:06.299" style="s2">in each free network it is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:09.780" style="s2">significant amount at the end of the year that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.299" end="01:00:11.940" style="s2">we manage to reduce ok so this was</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.780" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">the great first phase you digitize</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.940" end="01:00:17.780" style="s2">all those</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">legacy documents right and now this system</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.780" end="01:00:22.260" style="s2">automatically inside the anus already generates</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.359" style="s2">our anus is the Maintenance Control System</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.260" end="01:00:26.700" style="s2">already generates the tasks with a</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.359" end="01:00:28.619" style="s2">cover sheet like me  I said when the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.700" end="01:00:31.799" style="s2">technician scans That package That</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.619" end="01:00:32.819" style="s2">package from the correct place so this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.799" end="01:00:36.299" style="s2">the first step that we did the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.819" end="01:00:39.960" style="s2">digitalization of the documents and the second</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.299" end="01:00:43.619" style="s2">phase was exactly the adoption of a taxi</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.960" end="01:00:45.660" style="s2">Electronic card with digital signature, right? And</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.619" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">this step was extremely important, the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.660" end="01:00:50.460" style="s2">participation of  ANAC and again I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:52.140" style="s2">thank you for all the involvement and</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.460" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">support that we had to implement</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.140" end="01:00:57.299" style="s2">this because we started thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:01:00.299" style="s2">implementing this back in 2018 19 right, we</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.299" end="01:01:03.660" style="s2">started the process in 2020 and 2019</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.299" end="01:01:08.280" style="s2">saving from the pandemic was still a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.660" end="01:01:10.260" style="s2">Taboo not only  here but to read for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.280" end="01:01:13.559" style="s2">operator for authorities around the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.260" end="01:01:17.520" style="s2">world but we received a</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.559" end="01:01:19.799" style="s2">very nice activity from ANAC in us</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.520" end="01:01:22.619" style="s2">help in this process, especially in</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.799" end="01:01:24.420" style="s2">validating this digital signature, right? And it</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.619" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">was the critical part of this process</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.420" end="01:01:29.280" style="s2">so we started there in 2000 at the end</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:31.799" style="s2">of 2019 in 2020 we accelerated the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.280" end="01:01:34.740" style="s2">process and today we have the tasks</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.799" end="01:01:38.819" style="s2">within the design of a system that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.740" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">it calls fitsico from a processor that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.819" end="01:01:44.280" style="s2">calls in Power Max it takes the tasks</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:45.980" style="s2">that come out of both the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.280" end="01:01:49.559" style="s2">known maintenance information system</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.980" end="01:01:51.299" style="s2">it packages these tasks right within the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.559" end="01:01:54.780" style="s2">maintenance program it</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.299" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">creates this digital task where the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.780" end="01:02:00.740" style="s2">technician will access it on the tablet today</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.599" end="01:02:04.500" style="s2">our mechanic uses the iPad</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.740" end="01:02:07.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s cool Look if the technician let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.500" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">assume he&#39;s on vacation he&#39;s back from</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.500" end="01:02:12.839" style="s2">vacation he didn&#39;t see that his poroscopic course</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:15.140" style="s2">expired two days ago and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.839" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">he thinks everything is ok he arrives</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.140" end="01:02:22.440" style="s2">the supervisor assigns him</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:26.220" style="s2">like the person who will perform that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.440" end="01:02:30.839" style="s2">microscopic the system pulls the hostel and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.220" end="01:02:33.240" style="s2">does not leave the assignment of that task</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.839" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">So today the system automatically</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.240" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">picks up all the c  certifications of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:40.079" style="s2">qualifications of all technicians and only</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:42.839" style="s2">allows the designation of that technician if</p>

<p begin="01:03:49.260" end="01:03:55.380" style="s2">a year here, and the cost here of</p>

<p begin="01:03:55.380" end="01:03:59.940" style="s2">within the board just for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.780" end="01:04:02.220" style="s2">maintenance board, so that was the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.940" end="01:04:04.260" style="s2">second step of the project  and on the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.220" end="01:04:07.799" style="s2">hand, it&#39;s not the topic I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.260" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">bring up here today but it&#39;s the part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.799" end="01:04:14.819" style="s2">crew that has already worked on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">manual books all inside the iPad too and</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.819" end="01:04:18.059" style="s2">we&#39;ll end up meeting in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:22.380" style="s2">last phase of the project which is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.059" end="01:04:25.500" style="s2">the  logbook RT to this last phase will</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.380" end="01:04:27.960" style="s2">seal all the scanning part of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.500" end="01:04:30.359" style="s2">our maintenance and</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.960" end="01:04:32.700" style="s2">crew documents ok guys I think this one</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.359" end="01:04:36.180" style="s2">These were the big ones here</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.700" end="01:04:38.280" style="s2">so just remembering in scanning the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.180" end="01:04:40.859" style="s2">speed one that we find the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.280" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">documentation the quality that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.859" end="01:04:47.119" style="s2">earned within the process of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.720" end="01:04:50.220" style="s2">auditing the documentation</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.119" end="01:04:54.440" style="s2">on the free network, we also earn</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.220" end="01:04:54.440" style="s2">10 thousand dollars a day from</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.099" end="01:04:59.540" style="s2">a process that is totally accepted here by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.319" end="01:05:02.520" style="s2">lessors nowadays, right?  I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.540" end="01:05:04.680" style="s2">cool, I don&#39;t know if we can say</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.520" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">how cool the pandemic is, but this</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.680" end="01:05:10.020" style="s2">greatly accelerated the digitization and acceptance process,</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:11.660" style="s2">right, because it&#39;s no use for an</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.020" end="01:05:15.000" style="s2">Emperor to do what he does</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.660" end="01:05:17.579" style="s2">if others are like injuries, right?</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.000" end="01:05:19.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:17.579" end="01:05:21.780" style="s2">people are not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.140" end="01:05:23.099" style="s2">accept it, okay, I think this accelerated the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.780" end="01:05:25.799" style="s2">whole process between the operators,</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.099" end="01:05:27.420" style="s2">Aeronautical authorities and the sheets and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.799" end="01:05:31.440" style="s2">finally this final part of</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.420" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">digitizing the data and card and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.440" end="01:05:35.220" style="s2">execution, we also gain a lot in</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">quality control there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.220" end="01:05:40.440" style="s2">productivity</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:42.900" style="s2">the day people are still reducing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.440" end="01:05:44.460" style="s2">paper printing a lot ok so I think that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.900" end="01:05:46.020" style="s2">basically what I had to</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.460" end="01:05:49.500" style="s2">bring here from our Gol experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.020" end="01:05:55.079" style="s2">we are finalizing the implementation</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.500" end="01:05:57.480" style="s2">of the check to be in our</p>

<p begin="01:06:09.240" end="01:06:15.900" style="s2">thing is that I think that one thing that I think nobody has touched on</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.599" end="01:06:17.880" style="s2">here has to change, right?</p>

<p begin="01:07:15.660" end="01:07:19.980" style="s2">following for some time and here</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.660" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">I&#39;m actually going to take advantage of it  even to</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:25.380" style="s2">institutions, other organizations are</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.640" end="01:07:27.720" style="s2">also interested in sharing</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.380" end="01:07:31.559" style="s2">their views with the community with us, their</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.720" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">experiences because after this</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.559" end="01:07:35.339" style="s2">webinar was announced, we</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:37.559" style="s2">received access from several</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.339" end="01:07:39.539" style="s2">institutions, but it was very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.559" end="01:07:42.299" style="s2">for us to fit in  right, but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.539" end="01:07:44.339" style="s2">think we already have material</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.299" end="01:07:46.260" style="s2">for other editions.</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.339" end="01:07:48.599" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:57.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:55.500" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">I found it very interesting that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.960" end="01:08:03.299" style="s2">think this was something that came up</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:06.599" style="s2">common in all the presentations on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.299" end="01:08:08.280" style="s2">issue of the phases of the process is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.599" end="01:08:11.039" style="s2">really the digital transformation</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.280" end="01:08:14.339" style="s2">is not an event in itself, it&#39;s the process like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:15.900" style="s2">that, it&#39;s something that actually already  it started a</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.339" end="01:08:17.880" style="s2">long time ago, right? I think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.900" end="01:08:20.759" style="s2">practically all</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.880" end="01:08:24.299" style="s2">companies have already internally  working on eliminating</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.759" end="01:08:26.279" style="s2">manual records and increasingly moving</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.299" end="01:08:28.140" style="s2">towards electronic records,</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.279" end="01:08:29.699" style="s2">which have</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.140" end="01:08:32.520" style="s2">countless advantages, several of which have already been</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.699" end="01:08:34.199" style="s2">mentioned here, but it is also a process</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.520" end="01:08:35.819" style="s2">that does not end simply with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.199" end="01:08:38.520" style="s2">elimination of paper, but in fact I</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.819" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">think it  it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.520" end="01:08:43.440" style="s2">important milestone, right when we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:44.940" style="s2">say, no, from that moment on, a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.440" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">certain process of ours is now</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.940" end="01:08:50.580" style="s2">paperles or certain areas now we</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:52.679" style="s2">are, I think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.580" end="01:08:54.779" style="s2">important milestone, but I think that from there onwards</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.679" end="01:08:56.520" style="s2">, the transformation actually begins.</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.779" end="01:08:59.100" style="s2">From then on, the processes actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.520" end="01:09:01.560" style="s2">start to change. From then</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.100" end="01:09:03.540" style="s2">on, optimizations begin to appear, then</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.560" end="01:09:05.339" style="s2">we start to reduce rework,</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.540" end="01:09:07.679" style="s2">reduce errors.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.339" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:07.679" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">we live a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">very interesting moment here in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:20.160" style="s2">aviation environment where it&#39;s all this,</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:24.299" style="s2">right?  Making the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.160" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">inevitable is something inevitable as mine</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.299" end="01:09:29.580" style="s2">just said</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:31.799" style="s2">there is that fear of the new,</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.580" end="01:09:34.319" style="s2">so when we make the transition</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.799" end="01:09:36.420" style="s2">from what was paper to digital, the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.319" end="01:09:37.859" style="s2">person always has a certain fear, right, the</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.420" end="01:09:39.480" style="s2">person responsible for that is so satisfied</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.859" end="01:09:41.940" style="s2">Wow, but that goes  it works like it used to</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.480" end="01:09:43.560" style="s2">before, no, but the paper is no</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.940" end="01:09:46.739" style="s2">problem, no, the Tablet is going to be a problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.560" end="01:09:49.140" style="s2">anyway, but from the moment the</p>

<p begin="01:10:48.780" end="01:10:52.920" style="s2">IT specialists and sometimes it is very</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:54.780" style="s2">difficult for you to put everyone at the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.920" end="01:10:57.000" style="s2">table to speak the same language in</p>

<p begin="01:12:19.980" end="01:12:24.000" style="s2">had a role to play there in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:25.620" style="s2">of not  guys let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:27.480" style="s2">from the technology point of view this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.620" end="01:12:29.280" style="s2">need to be fulfilled from the point of</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.659" end="01:12:44.280" style="s2">we really another topic that I found</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.060" end="01:12:47.460" style="s2">very interesting like this is the breakdown of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.280" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">mindset really when we break</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.460" end="01:12:52.860" style="s2">this limitation that the role imposes on us is</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">a difficult process, right a change of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.860" end="01:12:55.699" style="s2">mind is always a very</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:58.440" style="s2">difficult process but  once it is done</p>

<p begin="01:12:58.440" end="01:13:03.960" style="s2">endless so now we are seeing</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.739" end="01:13:07.020" style="s2">this moment of a really</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.960" end="01:13:10.320" style="s2">great transformation, the mindsets</p>

<p begin="01:19:10.739" end="01:19:16.679" style="s2">for example, our</p>

<p begin="01:19:16.679" end="01:19:21.679" style="s2">I believe they are the most</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.620" end="01:19:26.100" style="s2">distant regions with internet difficulties,</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.679" end="01:19:28.440" style="s2">but this year we are.</p>

<p begin="01:19:39.179" end="01:19:41.780" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:19:41.900" end="01:19:47.400" style="s2">yeah, we really don&#39;t have it That&#39;s good Fernando Mila I think there was a</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.179" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">doubt here if there are still</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.400" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">physical documents at the end of the processes</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.900" end="01:20:01.820" style="s2">C is still physical ok we are</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.880" end="01:20:05.940" style="s2">pressing all for electronic now</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.820" end="01:20:08.219" style="s2">in the Confins unit and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.940" end="01:20:10.500" style="s2">line documents a  line will be the third or</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.219" end="01:20:11.880" style="s2">third point that we will turn the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.500" end="01:20:13.560" style="s2">key to electronic document So</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.880" end="01:20:15.480" style="s2">in a while we</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.560" end="01:20:19.380" style="s2">will actually be producing all documents</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.480" end="01:20:22.440" style="s2">digitally but it&#39;s still not</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.380" end="01:20:26.280" style="s2">great and one more doubt Gol</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.440" end="01:20:28.380" style="s2">uses both for documentation  electronics</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.280" end="01:20:32.659" style="s2">let&#39;s go to the information and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.380" end="01:20:35.420" style="s2">control system right it generates the system</p>

<p begin="01:20:35.420" end="01:20:41.280" style="s2">maintenance right and generates the electronic task</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.940" end="01:20:44.340" style="s2">ok so the electronic task is not</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:46.260" style="s2">through the anus despite the anus I understand</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.340" end="01:20:49.440" style="s2">that they are trying to develop a</p>

<p begin="01:20:49.560" end="01:20:54.719" style="s2">ok great now we have a question for</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.140" end="01:21:03.960" style="s2">question room is the investment was very high in</p>

<p begin="01:22:06.780" end="01:22:09.980" style="s2">it will not take long,</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.560" end="01:22:21.420" style="s2">no our system it started to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.320" end="01:22:24.840" style="s2">developed in mid  2016 and</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.420" end="01:22:26.760" style="s2">January 2018 it was already complete and operating</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.840" end="01:22:29.580" style="s2">the only thing that was missing at the time for</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.760" end="01:22:32.100" style="s2">us was the homologation of the</p>

<p begin="01:22:42.860" end="01:22:48.600" style="s2">on the part of the Military Police the</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.679" end="01:22:50.940" style="s2">financial investment was not great,</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.600" end="01:22:54.980" style="s2">we invested more in the availability</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.940" end="01:22:57.719" style="s2">of our time.  our team Because as it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.980" end="01:23:00.239" style="s2">a laboratory it was the first company it</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.719" end="01:23:03.500" style="s2">was the first state agency</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.239" end="01:23:06.239" style="s2">that wanted to carry out this digital transformation</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.500" end="01:23:09.900" style="s2">the company that was providing us with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.239" end="01:23:12.900" style="s2">service it worked together</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.900" end="01:23:14.940" style="s2">and did not require a financial glove</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.900" end="01:23:16.320" style="s2">for this to be done that it  they already</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.940" end="01:23:19.560" style="s2">knew that up front they were able to</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.320" end="01:23:22.140" style="s2">sell to other bodies so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.560" end="01:23:25.560" style="s2">paid the same during that time then the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.140" end="01:23:28.080" style="s2">monthly fee for normal use didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.560" end="01:23:32.040" style="s2">any more courses than that now</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:34.320" style="s2">about the return The return is notorious the</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.040" end="01:23:36.239" style="s2">return it is very  in addition to what was</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.320" end="01:23:38.460" style="s2">invested for us, I believe that in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.239" end="01:23:41.880" style="s2">first year of use it was already worth it</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.460" end="01:23:45.179" style="s2">because today the system works for</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.880" end="01:23:48.840" style="s2">us as a matrix, it feeds</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.179" end="01:23:52.020" style="s2">all sessions and today all our</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.940" end="01:23:59.219" style="s2">so we gained time, gained</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.040" end="01:24:01.980" style="s2">quality, gained effectiveness and safety in</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.219" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">that, I believe the feedback was</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.980" end="01:24:07.440" style="s2">very positive, it&#39;s hard for me to talk</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:10.580" style="s2">about Pro like that  how much it was but the gain was</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.440" end="01:24:14.040" style="s2">much higher than invested</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.580" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">Thank you Gabriela Leandro I would like to</p>

<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:39.900" style="s2">with the issue of the operational report, right</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.739" end="01:24:42.420" style="s2">that we implemented and did it</p>

<p begin="01:25:11.239" end="01:25:16.679" style="s2">in terms of return, we already saw it</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.060" end="01:26:06.960" style="s2">digitizing the liabilities, so we</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.219" end="01:26:09.260" style="s2">had this doubt: are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.960" end="01:26:12.659" style="s2">make the liabilities or not the liabilities,</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.260" end="01:26:15.179" style="s2">but we decided to do it and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.659" end="01:26:17.280" style="s2">investment pays for itself in up to two years</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.179" end="01:26:19.620" style="s2">by the number of books you produce</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.280" end="01:26:21.179" style="s2">there is, so you reduce the number</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.620" end="01:26:23.639" style="s2">of people who are working on that</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.179" end="01:26:26.100" style="s2">delivery thing a lot and you reduce the number</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.100" end="01:26:32.100" style="s2">a suitable document t  so for those who</p>

<p begin="01:26:32.100" end="01:26:36.360" style="s2">this process to render free, it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.620" end="01:26:39.179" style="s2">intense, my suggestion is to really</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.360" end="01:26:41.400" style="s2">start doing all the liabilities,</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.020" end="01:26:57.000" style="s2">digital part and digital signature it does not have</p>

<p begin="01:26:58.920" end="01:27:03.420" style="s2">investment of resources, right of people</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.719" end="01:27:05.820" style="s2">to do the integration the integration is</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.420" end="01:27:08.580" style="s2">more complex But even in this process</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.820" end="01:27:11.400" style="s2">too  we see a return of one year to</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.580" end="01:27:13.699" style="s2">18 months there on the initial investment in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.400" end="01:27:16.940" style="s2">system and then it pays for itself</p>

<p begin="01:32:27.360" end="01:32:35.120" style="s2">demanding, right in that sense but what I</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.199" end="01:32:35.120" style="s2">I would like to emphasize that this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.580" end="01:32:41.580" style="s2">everything that comes up new and I would say that the</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.940" end="01:32:44.219" style="s2">whole normative set related</p>

<p begin="01:32:50.940" end="01:32:56.520" style="s2">&#39;s all  what we understand that</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.420" end="01:32:59.400" style="s2">for whatever reason is not adding</p>

<p begin="01:33:04.560" end="01:33:10.860" style="s2">that the rule does not contribute but that it</p>

<p begin="01:33:10.860" end="01:33:15.960" style="s2">corresponding counterpart is very  It&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.900" end="01:33:19.159" style="s2">we receive these inputs for those who</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.960" end="01:33:21.780" style="s2">evolved our rule, if that&#39;s the case, in</p>

<p begin="01:33:27.659" end="01:33:30.540" style="s2">we&#39;ll start the</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.980" end="01:33:33.060" style="s2">process of no, this needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.540" end="01:33:36.239" style="s2">modified, this isn&#39;t adding to this, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.060" end="01:33:37.800" style="s2">actually in the evolution, so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.239" end="01:33:41.159" style="s2">work on this  so I want to reinforce this</p>

<p begin="01:33:57.239" end="01:34:01.560" style="s2">is that what is not adding</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.120" end="01:34:03.800" style="s2">is brought so that we can</p>

<p begin="01:34:12.600" end="01:34:18.020" style="s2">electronic signatures, you know, in Brazil there is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.719" end="01:34:20.520" style="s2">requirement for an</p>

<p begin="01:34:20.520" end="01:34:25.100" style="s2">is required  also by other</p>

<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:34.560" style="s2">Aeronautical authorities our market has its peculiarities</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.739" end="01:34:37.139" style="s2">right And this is not specific to the version it</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.560" end="01:34:40.159" style="s2">is not specific to the electronic signature  nica</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.440" end="01:35:19.199" style="s2">difference, right Mainly for those</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.320" end="01:35:21.780" style="s2">operators who operate companies that</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.199" end="01:35:24.900" style="s2">end up having interfaces with various</p>

<p begin="01:35:24.900" end="01:35:28.860" style="s2">civil  I think that here this ends up being</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.239" end="01:35:30.739" style="s2">almost inevitable, you know, the same</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.860" end="01:35:34.920" style="s2">small companies deal with</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.739" end="01:35:36.620" style="s2">foreign suppliers. So this</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.920" end="01:35:40.679" style="s2">contact with other countries ends up</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.620" end="01:35:46.040" style="s2">being intense.</p>

<p begin="01:35:51.719" end="01:35:57.300" style="s2">difference really has to exist,</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.760" end="01:36:00.300" style="s2">today I believe that our rule  Well,</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.300" end="01:36:02.460" style="s2">my perception is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.300" end="01:36:04.500" style="s2">quite robust But it is quite</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.460" end="01:36:07.440" style="s2">robust, which makes it</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.500" end="01:36:10.500" style="s2">very reliable.</p>

<p begin="01:36:15.800" end="01:36:21.440" style="s2">eventually It may be that for</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.780" end="01:36:24.840" style="s2">most of the records we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.440" end="01:36:27.420" style="s2">the compliance to</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.840" end="01:36:29.820" style="s2">be higher, it is more it</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.420" end="01:36:31.620" style="s2">is very robust but as a result it</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.820" end="01:36:32.760" style="s2">ends up being very demanding, its</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.620" end="01:36:34.020" style="s2">development ends up being very</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.760" end="01:36:36.300" style="s2">difficult sometimes its implementation  it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.020" end="01:36:37.620" style="s2">very difficult, so there may be cases</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.300" end="01:36:40.020" style="s2">where we can&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.620" end="01:36:41.940" style="s2">this level of demand, but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.020" end="01:36:44.520" style="s2">quite likely that in</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.940" end="01:36:45.980" style="s2">most cases, if not most of them, we</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.520" end="01:36:49.800" style="s2">don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.980" end="01:36:52.580" style="s2">demand it in its entirety and we</p>

<p begin="01:37:31.080" end="01:37:36.179" style="s2">I will bring a curiosity it was not</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.600" end="01:37:38.120" style="s2">mentioned here but the Minas Gerais Military Police</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.179" end="01:37:41.639" style="s2">was the first logbook</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.120" end="01:37:44.460" style="s2">approved for use in Brazil was the</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.639" end="01:37:46.500" style="s2">first body that we approved and no,</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.460" end="01:37:49.139" style="s2">it is not like that, from the point</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.500" end="01:37:51.780" style="s2">of view of rules, there is no difference</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.139" end="01:37:53.159" style="s2">today There is no difference in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.780" end="01:37:55.920" style="s2">rule that would be applied, for example,</p>

<p begin="01:42:15.360" end="01:42:22.380" style="s2">and there was even the question there it was not possible to see</p>

<p begin="01:42:28.560" end="01:42:33.300" style="s2">much more laborious to develop</p>

<p begin="01:42:33.300" end="01:42:37.440" style="s2">send the process, we produced it</p>

<p begin="01:42:37.440" end="01:42:44.219" style="s2">So it was a long journey,</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.900" end="01:42:47.219" style="s2">but there were no legal barriers  there</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.219" end="01:42:49.560" style="s2">was no more or</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.219" end="01:42:54.540" style="s2">less requirement, right? we complied with</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.560" end="01:42:57.900" style="s2">rbat 90, it&#39;s a standard that</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.540" end="01:43:00.659" style="s2">demands a lot from us because we operate on</p>

<p begin="01:43:00.659" end="01:43:06.000" style="s2">so it poses a</p>

<p begin="01:43:12.420" end="01:43:17.760" style="s2">stricter standards so I think the most</p>

<p begin="01:43:59.480" end="01:44:06.360" style="s2">at the beginning  it was a little difficult, although</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.420" end="01:44:11.639" style="s2">everyone was looking for this change,</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.360" end="01:44:13.739" style="s2">we felt a little afraid, as the</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.639" end="01:44:15.780" style="s2">Captain said, a lot of people asked, right,</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.739" end="01:44:18.420" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t change only the</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.780" end="01:44:20.699" style="s2">digital operational report, we started</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.420" end="01:44:23.460" style="s2">using this Natura for</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.699" end="01:44:25.739" style="s2">digital certificates in the company So  this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.460" end="01:44:28.080" style="s2">question we had to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.739" end="01:44:30.560" style="s2">almost every week, right</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.080" end="01:44:33.239" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="01:44:38.520" end="01:44:42.420" style="s2">?  company&#39;s internal rule</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.380" end="01:44:45.619" style="s2">that absolutely no one has</p>

<p begin="01:44:45.619" end="01:44:50.880" style="s2">just to bring  r this security</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.119" end="01:44:53.159" style="s2">for them, right, but as we did this</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.880" end="01:44:55.679" style="s2">adaptation period of three months, right,</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.159" end="01:44:58.320" style="s2">physical report with the digital report,</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.679" end="01:45:00.659" style="s2">they started to realize that the</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.320" end="01:45:03.480" style="s2">backpack was getting lighter, they</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.659" end="01:45:04.980" style="s2">didn&#39;t have so much time to fill in the hand,</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.480" end="01:45:06.600" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t getting sore because they</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.980" end="01:45:08.100" style="s2">they complained a lot, right that sometimes they had</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.600" end="01:45:11.580" style="s2">to fill out the document so much that they</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.100" end="01:45:13.500" style="s2">got very tired, right, so it was in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.580" end="01:45:16.080" style="s2">the workday of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.500" end="01:45:17.760" style="s2">agricultural pilot, right, being very different from that of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.080" end="01:45:20.460" style="s2">other pilots, they had to spend</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.760" end="01:45:22.440" style="s2">more time analyzing the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.460" end="01:45:24.719" style="s2">documentation because they always came here</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.440" end="01:45:27.420" style="s2">it was wrong, I hit it back to them, right,</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.719" end="01:45:30.360" style="s2">so after they realized that</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.420" end="01:45:31.920" style="s2">their time gain was greater, today</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.360" end="01:45:33.719" style="s2">we have the scene pilots who say</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.920" end="01:45:36.780" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to trade for anything, you know,</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.719" end="01:45:38.580" style="s2">and we have older people</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.780" end="01:45:41.659" style="s2">in the company, right?  we were</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.580" end="01:45:44.580" style="s2">very afraid of them not wanting</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.659" end="01:45:46.500" style="s2">to adapt to this new reality but today</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.580" end="01:45:47.760" style="s2">they are the ones who understand the most, sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.500" end="01:45:50.699" style="s2">they understand the  There&#39;s more than the people</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.760" end="01:45:52.920" style="s2">who created the database And then</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.699" end="01:45:54.300" style="s2">they give a silent suggestion in the field and</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.920" end="01:45:57.179" style="s2">we&#39;re going to work together,</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.300" end="01:45:59.400" style="s2">but the whole team really adhered and doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.179" end="01:46:02.100" style="s2">change anymore, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.400" end="01:46:04.699" style="s2">great, thanks Gabriela Leandro, do you</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.100" end="01:46:04.699" style="s2">want to put something in</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.520" end="01:46:10.560" style="s2">or would it be more like what Gabi</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.380" end="01:46:11.420" style="s2">said I just thank you for the</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.560" end="01:46:13.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:46:11.420" end="01:46:16.739" style="s2">opportunity we</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.460" end="01:46:18.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s great to be able to even disclose this gain</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.739" end="01:46:21.119" style="s2">because one of the lines even from our</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.600" end="01:46:24.020" style="s2">director even if he would be unhappy and</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.119" end="01:46:27.420" style="s2">even more companies is also</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.020" end="01:46:30.600" style="s2">this system to the other Because</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.420" end="01:46:33.060" style="s2">as people go, right, being in the system,</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.600" end="01:46:35.580" style="s2">the system is better, so for us</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.060" end="01:46:37.980" style="s2">it would also be good because more people</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.580" end="01:46:41.100" style="s2">using it, more people testing it,</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.980" end="01:46:42.960" style="s2">different situations appear, so it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.100" end="01:46:44.820" style="s2">gain as a whole, right, it would be good for</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.960" end="01:46:46.500" style="s2">everyone, so thank you again for the</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.820" end="01:46:48.199" style="s2">opportunity and that would be it</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.500" end="01:46:52.500" style="s2">Thank you</p>

<p begin="01:47:00.420" end="01:47:05.820" style="s2">right people  s are worried about being</p>

<p begin="01:47:05.820" end="01:47:10.619" style="s2">to adapt to the system is replacement</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.340" end="01:47:12.780" style="s2">I think we see here how the</p>

<p begin="01:47:12.780" end="01:47:16.860" style="s2">moving to other positions Because</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.360" end="01:47:20.300" style="s2">at the end of the day we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.860" end="01:47:22.800" style="s2">fight against this technology</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.300" end="01:47:25.080" style="s2">same as a later company And then</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.800" end="01:47:28.619" style="s2">six months a year five years</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.080" end="01:47:30.119" style="s2">is inevitable, right so I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.619" end="01:47:32.460" style="s2">our team&#39;s awareness</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.119" end="01:47:35.159" style="s2">help them look for another position</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.460" end="01:47:36.840" style="s2">extremely important multiplication then</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.159" end="01:47:38.780" style="s2">I think we have done How we</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.840" end="01:47:41.639" style="s2">have to work</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.780" end="01:47:45.000" style="s2">this is the first point second point of</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.639" end="01:47:49.760" style="s2">adaptation today the systems or</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.000" end="01:47:53.040" style="s2">suppliers have been careful to</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.760" end="01:47:56.639" style="s2">design an extremely simple system,</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.040" end="01:47:58.260" style="s2">right, super intuitive so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.639" end="01:48:00.900" style="s2">Gabriela said that even the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.260" end="01:48:03.600" style="s2">oldest people can pick up a tablet and</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.900" end="01:48:06.060" style="s2">simply touch to  back and forth the</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.600" end="01:48:07.560" style="s2">logic of the iPad, everyone has mastered</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.060" end="01:48:10.619" style="s2">little finger up down inwards</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.560" end="01:48:12.420" style="s2">a button is very simple So I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.619" end="01:48:15.540" style="s2">that we have seen here that all that</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.420" end="01:48:17.280" style="s2">fear that people had has already fallen to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.540" end="01:48:19.260" style="s2">ground and that&#39;s what I said here, our</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.280" end="01:48:22.380" style="s2">team from Congonhas, for example, said no,</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.260" end="01:48:25.560" style="s2">this system here doesn&#39;t lie anymore, right?</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.380" end="01:48:28.699" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:48:25.560" end="01:48:32.159" style="s2">taking the opportunity just to close here</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.699" end="01:48:33.360" style="s2">I would like to pick up a hook on what Captain</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.159" end="01:48:36.179" style="s2">Nogueira said I think first of all the people</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.360" end="01:48:39.920" style="s2">here congratulations for being</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.179" end="01:48:44.000" style="s2">pioneers right but the cool thing It took work</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.920" end="01:48:47.100" style="s2">but as Captain Nogueira said there was</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.000" end="01:48:49.380" style="s2">no barrier in fact they are</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.100" end="01:48:52.199" style="s2">in a very great partnership  with anak</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.380" end="01:48:54.179" style="s2">during this process and it was a little</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.199" end="01:48:56.880" style="s2">more laborious I think exactly</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.179" end="01:48:59.100" style="s2">because of learning a lot, right?</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.880" end="01:49:00.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:48:59.100" end="01:49:03.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:49:00.960" end="01:49:05.639" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:49:03.600" end="01:49:08.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:49:05.639" end="01:49:12.239" style="s2">this transformation is happening now, it</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.420" end="01:49:15.900" style="s2">&#39;s important that they start doing it,</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.239" end="01:49:18.239" style="s2">like Leandro here said, the more</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.900" end="01:49:20.400" style="s2">we have acceptance in the market with  the</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.239" end="01:49:23.159" style="s2">whole but we will see the benefit even</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.400" end="01:49:25.500" style="s2">for each company Because as the person</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.159" end="01:49:29.040" style="s2">says if the operators don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.500" end="01:49:30.780" style="s2">that we start having to do</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.040" end="01:49:33.780" style="s2">what the operators want in general</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.780" end="01:49:37.080" style="s2">ok so call the message here</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.780" end="01:49:39.480" style="s2">tell us  also if you need any</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.080" end="01:49:41.040" style="s2">information we are very open here</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.480" end="01:49:42.380" style="s2">to receive any company to</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.040" end="01:49:44.639" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.380" end="01:49:48.800" style="s2">and congratulations to Naque here for the</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.639" end="01:49:48.800" style="s2">initiative big hug to everyone there I</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.400" end="01:49:53.900" style="s2">would like to say some final words</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.639" end="01:50:02.239" style="s2">again I think I don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.300" end="01:50:06.300" style="s2">thank all this group that is here</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.239" end="01:50:09.000" style="s2">I&#39;m very satisfied with the reports. In</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.300" end="01:50:10.380" style="s2">fact, even some may be surprising.</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.000" end="01:50:12.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:50:10.380" end="01:50:14.940" style="s2"></p>

<p begin="01:50:19.920" end="01:50:23.760" style="s2">this does not only happen in</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.840" end="01:50:26.400" style="s2">companies internally here</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.760" end="01:50:28.500" style="s2">we are also in this process not only with</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.400" end="01:50:31.320" style="s2">our own with our people in</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.500" end="01:50:33.600" style="s2">our induction team  spectors but</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.320" end="01:50:35.880" style="s2">even with us sometimes, yeah,</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.600" end="01:50:37.619" style="s2">personally, at various times I find</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.880" end="01:50:39.800" style="s2">myself with a certain resistance with</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.619" end="01:50:45.199" style="s2">some things but what</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.800" end="01:50:45.199" style="s2">really is is the price of pioneering spirit</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.699" end="01:50:52.080" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you are feeling that,</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.560" end="01:50:52.940" style="s2">right, but we are already participating today</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.080" end="01:50:57.119" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.940" end="01:50:58.800" style="s2">groups formed by authorities the</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:11.220" style="s2">present specific case I believe that the amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.339" end="00:11:13.380" style="s2">currently set at 80 thousand is not capable</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.220" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">of fully achieving the function of the sanction,</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.380" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">in particular because it corresponds to an amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.140" end="00:11:21.480" style="s2">that may initially be borne by</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:24.540" style="s2">an individual crew member, in view of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.480" end="00:11:26.100" style="s2">situation, it is necessary to modulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.540" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">a  Sanctioning quantum in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.100" end="00:11:31.079" style="s2">establish a pecuniary penalty</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:33.720" style="s2">that reaches the functions for which it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.079" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">originally created That is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:38.100" style="s2">the infraction committed is proportional and reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">in a punished way and to</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">I therefore suggest the use of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.000" end="00:11:57.180" style="s2">of the fine, I understand that this system</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:59.820" style="s2">generates a fine amount that is not as high</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.180" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">as originally fixed nor so low</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.820" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">that it improperly stimulates the</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">concessionaires have always had this obligation</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:28.020" style="s2">to carry out data communication from</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.580" end="00:34:36.599" style="s2">new obligation and secondly, these new</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.419" end="00:34:39.780" style="s2">regulations would not have implied</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.580" end="00:34:46.440" style="s2">Federal Revenue unit, there would have been a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:48.899" style="s2">simplification of sending  of information and</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.440" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">not a movement to make</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">cost, but a process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.399" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">simplifying the systems.  There is</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.640" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">no doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.820" style="s2">concessionaires have always had an obligation</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:13.500" style="s2">to send information to the</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:28.619" style="s2">now a much more</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.740" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">sophisticated system a requirement laid down</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">therefore the obligation does not change but there is</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.240" end="00:35:58.920" style="s2">there is a great impact on these</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">so that it could</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:23.220" style="s2">adapt to these new</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">Federal Revenue requirements and  it was found that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.220" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">Basically nothing from the old system could</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">renewed it is a system the current system</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:33.720" style="s2">it has already been implemented the dealership</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:35.579" style="s2">is already using it the current software</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.720" end="00:36:37.260" style="s2">it is much more modern it is already in</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.579" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">operation and it is completely  different</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.260" end="00:36:42.359" style="s2">from the previous one, so it was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">substantial investment. And besides, this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.359" end="00:36:46.440" style="s2">recognized by the revenue itself because,</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:48.900" style="s2">in fact, over the years, the</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.800" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">therefore, the revenue itself recognizes that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:10.140" style="s2">there was a substantial technical change</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:13.320" style="s2">in the way these as this system</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">important to note the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:32.220" style="s2">concession contracts are long term contracts</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:35.700" style="s2">they last 10 20 30 40 years and it is natural</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.220" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">that within this perspective the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.700" end="00:37:40.920" style="s2">public interest changes the  technologies change that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">indisputable and it is natural that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.920" end="00:37:45.960" style="s2">concessionaires have investments to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:47.579" style="s2">made aimed at this exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.960" end="00:37:49.859" style="s2">public interests and especially</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.579" end="00:37:51.540" style="s2">new technologies the technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.859" end="00:37:53.160" style="s2">now are undoubtedly different</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.540" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">from the technologies of 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:57.060" style="s2">so it is under discussion in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:00.420" style="s2">present  if it is not whether the concessionaire</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.060" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">owes these determinations to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.420" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">the Federal Revenue or not, the</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.960" end="00:38:08.820" style="s2">expanded what is being discussed is precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">counterpart so once having</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.820" end="00:38:14.040" style="s2">made high investments it is natural that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">any company needs to recompose</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.040" end="00:38:18.060" style="s2">its  the balance sheet needs him to recompose his</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.060" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">costs which were quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.859" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">substantial costs as I said, approaching</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:28.760" style="s2">one million and 700 thousand reais and to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:31.020" style="s2">close the concessionaire he also does not</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.940" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">case is that at the height of the process,</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.900" style="s2">the financial impact was not even discussed, nor was it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:44.760" style="s2">discussed whether the</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.340" end="01:13:49.140" style="s2">in this case is that a request from our</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.060" end="01:13:52.140" style="s2">defense would be the reformulation of the modulation</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.739" end="01:14:22.520" style="s2">checking income, so it wouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="01:14:29.219" end="01:14:34.219" style="s2">throughout the Defense right We requested</p>

<p begin="01:14:45.980" end="01:14:54.179" style="s2">despite not having accepted it  right the</p>

<p begin="01:14:54.179" end="01:15:00.179" style="s2">relevant Because once the</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.380" end="01:15:23.040" style="s2">so there is no need for</p>

<p begin="01:15:35.580" end="01:15:40.380" style="s2">already follow that the  penalty of</p>

<p begin="01:15:42.179" end="01:15:48.179" style="s2">the only manifestation in this sense that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.239" end="01:15:49.920" style="s2">defense can make is to recall that</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.179" end="01:15:52.800" style="s2">justice, right, and the judgment has to be</p>

<p begin="01:16:26.600" end="01:16:34.500" style="s2">we agree with a reprimand to</p>

<p begin="00:18:34.980" end="00:18:38.179" style="s2">we could say that the state of the art</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.750" end="00:18:42.630" style="s2">today at least from the theoretical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.179" end="00:18:44.910" style="s2">on aviation accidents  it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.630" end="00:18:51.000" style="s2">closely related to the logic that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.910" end="00:18:54.419" style="s2">accident is organizational na it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.000" end="00:18:57.780" style="s2">cannot be treated as an event it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.419" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">is generated by an individual or by some</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">organizational event because it is up to the organization</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:07.470" style="s2">selected in the people to define which</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:10.110" style="s2">equipment will be used define  only</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.470" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">what circumstances will the operation be</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.110" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">carried out which risks will be acceptable</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">so in that sense the organization ends up</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.490" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">creating a context in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:24.750" style="s2">all the operational activity takes place and of course this</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:26.820" style="s2">is not the isolated number because this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.750" end="00:19:28.950" style="s2">exists in the  the other layer, let&#39;s say a</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.390" end="00:19:38.590" style="s2">could say that the accident</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.909" end="00:19:42.039" style="s2">air accidents today they are treated</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.590" end="00:19:44.409" style="s2">a lot like organizational accidents and</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.730" end="00:22:39.480" style="s2">talking for sure there will be a subject for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.490" end="00:22:41.790" style="s2">long time but the idea a little today the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.480" end="00:22:44.370" style="s2">request of the only one that was we focus</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.790" end="00:22:46.260" style="s2">more on how this history has been the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.370" end="00:22:48.150" style="s2">implementation  of these concepts in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.260" end="00:22:49.800" style="s2">regulatory structure, right, I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.150" end="00:22:51.680" style="s2">talk a little about how we</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.800" end="00:22:55.260" style="s2">are implementing this here in Brazil,</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.680" end="00:22:59.640" style="s2">plus a greater focus on the evolution of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.260" end="00:23:02.310" style="s2">in the structure there of the voice and just taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.640" end="00:23:05.160" style="s2">the word, congratulations to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.310" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">you there wagner  lucky team for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.160" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">promotion initiatives, I think they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:11.480" style="s2">very important even if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:14.490" style="s2">manage to bring quality information,</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.480" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">right, some things that we already</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.490" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">enter in the mind of the agency or</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:23.020" style="s2">quality material that we receive from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:24.910" style="s2">partners, then the clothes will be that  I&#39;m telling you about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.020" end="00:23:29.110" style="s2">one of the sources of coded information</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.910" end="00:23:31.150" style="s2">that we have for general aviation,</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.110" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">for operational safety as a whole, I</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.150" end="00:23:34.660" style="s2">think these initiatives will help</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:37.000" style="s2">a lot to make this information</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.660" end="00:23:38.620" style="s2">reach those who really need</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.000" end="00:23:42.250" style="s2">more operational personnel, so congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">again to the  initiative is I think you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.250" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">just as a general introduction, I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.930" style="s2">the professor&#39;s presentation is very relevant</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">because it gave the context of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.930" end="00:23:55.570" style="s2">how the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:59.230" style="s2">evolved, what we expect</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.570" end="00:24:02.230" style="s2">from this implementation and everything  well</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.230" end="00:24:04.420" style="s2">there are things that are positive but I</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.230" end="00:24:06.220" style="s2">need to think about how to incorporate it and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.420" end="00:24:08.890" style="s2">in terms of regulation is not always a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.220" end="00:24:11.920" style="s2">good idea when it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.890" end="00:24:13.510" style="s2">mandatory it gets better, so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.920" end="00:24:16.690" style="s2">what is the logic how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.510" end="00:24:18.460" style="s2">incorporate the concepts into the rule  here</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.690" end="00:24:22.120" style="s2">historically what we always did</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.460" end="00:24:23.000" style="s2">was existed right then we commented there</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.120" end="00:24:26.420" style="s2">at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.000" end="00:24:29.390" style="s2">and the improvement of operational safety</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.420" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">we went there they identified problems there</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.390" end="00:24:32.930" style="s2">more at the beginning normally in relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:35.210" style="s2">project after the issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.930" end="00:24:37.460" style="s2">contribution of individuals in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.210" end="00:24:40.310" style="s2">system afterwards  more organizational part</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.460" end="00:24:44.510" style="s2">but normally the answer was like this they went</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.310" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">there they identified danger they welded if the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.510" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">problem identified the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.820" end="00:24:51.020" style="s2">of dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:53.930" style="s2">specific problem or specific actions to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.020" end="00:24:56.390" style="s2">mitigate that problem and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.930" end="00:24:58.850" style="s2">normally incorporated if that in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.390" end="00:25:01.400" style="s2">regulatory framework requirements were created for</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:03.290" style="s2">those those defenses  that were</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.400" end="00:25:04.790" style="s2">developed were implemented</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.290" end="00:25:06.620" style="s2">throughout the system and I knew we</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.119" end="00:25:58.840" style="s2">then I have a series of things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.730" style="s2">are established in the regulations and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.840" end="00:26:03.879" style="s2">are important to be addressed by</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.879" end="00:26:11.169" style="s2">of any company is to try to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:13.269" style="s2">compliance I need to work</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.169" end="00:26:15.429" style="s2">to ensure that my company complies</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.710" end="00:27:32.679" style="s2">the industry and how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.769" end="00:27:35.409" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.679" end="00:27:39.159" style="s2">these specific risks are</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.159" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">prescriptive way, we will see less delimited</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.639" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2">in the a priori rule and leaves a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:48.820" style="s2">more flexibility  for the operators</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:51.249" style="s2">to try to identify the specific causes</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.820" end="00:27:53.259" style="s2">that their operations are exposed to, the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.249" end="00:27:54.789" style="s2">idea then was the implementation of</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.789" end="00:28:01.990" style="s2">operational safety management systems and it has this focus of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.929" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">being a regulation item at the same time, it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.990" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">requires a change of thinking from  that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.429" style="s2">not only complied with the regulation is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">enough I also need to address</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.429" end="00:28:14.470" style="s2">those dangers here my operation</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">will be exposed and I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.470" end="00:28:19.419" style="s2">this in a structured way and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:22.779" style="s2">the incorporation of the concepts and</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.890" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">and how this concept was then</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.960" end="00:28:35.000" style="s2">incorporated there by accinelli</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">initially it did not exist this</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.030" end="00:28:49.960" style="s2">but people have already started to think  on</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.860" end="00:28:52.160" style="s2">how to incorporate these these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.960" end="00:28:56.630" style="s2">management systems into</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.160" end="00:29:00.290" style="s2">disney management and with that back in 2001 al assi</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.630" end="00:29:03.380" style="s2">created its first annex charged</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.290" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">air traffic service providers and</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:14.600" style="s2">this evolves quickly, right, even with</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.600" end="00:29:23.270" style="s2">industries there and then in 2006, oaci</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.400" end="00:29:26.420" style="s2">reviewed these annexes and went on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.270" end="00:29:27.870" style="s2">demand the implementation of sms, which is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.420" end="00:29:30.809" style="s2">we know today the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.870" end="00:29:33.660" style="s2">operational security system and  then what is the name</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.809" end="00:29:35.940" style="s2">of the time understanding these</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.660" end="00:29:38.820" style="s2">benefits that I mentioned we would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.940" end="00:29:41.190" style="s2">to balance more or less</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.820" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">prescriptive requirements with effectiveness the same as the</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.880" style="s2">private operator ok husband this was being</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.110" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">implemented within the various annexes</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.880" end="00:29:54.680" style="s2">so the ones themselves  operators there from to</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">evolved to cover all the</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.100" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">oh but that&#39;s ok the logic is positive it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.309" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">works for the operators they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:28.120" style="s2">understand their children but if this</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:29.860" style="s2">logic works for the operators who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:32.500" style="s2">specific risks to see if it</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.860" end="00:30:34.240" style="s2">also works for the states the states</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.500" end="00:30:36.940" style="s2">are also responsible  for implementing</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.280" end="00:30:47.169" style="s2">cover these more systems that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.230" end="00:30:50.590" style="s2">mentioned and from this also came the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.169" end="00:30:52.870" style="s2">implementing an analogue to an SMS for</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.590" end="00:30:56.020" style="s2">the states which was called the  side</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.020" end="00:31:00.040" style="s2">and what is the excess what is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.750" style="s2">ssp is a management system focused on</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.040" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">improving the regulatory and</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.220" end="00:31:12.040" style="s2">commented on the components right the logic of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.460" end="00:31:15.160" style="s2">system is very  similar despite the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.040" end="00:31:17.410" style="s2">state does not operate directly it is not good</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.160" end="00:31:19.300" style="s2">to have more direct actions to mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.410" end="00:31:21.160" style="s2">a risk of operations this for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.300" end="00:31:24.250" style="s2">operators the service providers there</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.160" end="00:31:27.310" style="s2">as I mentioned is the system that should</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.250" end="00:31:29.740" style="s2">run in the state is very similar to the one</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.310" end="00:31:31.330" style="s2">that runs  not service provider</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.740" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">there we have the four</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.330" end="00:31:38.260" style="s2">components of the ssp which are objectives</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">resources and policy objectives and in the case</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.780" end="00:31:47.710" style="s2">in the same way that one these components</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.910" end="00:31:49.030" style="s2">are present there for the  service providers</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.710" end="00:31:52.060" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:31:49.030" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">to go to the states so steel</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.060" end="00:31:56.260" style="s2">was also incorporating these concepts in its</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:06.670" style="s2">implementation of sp were incorporated</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.220" end="00:32:09.270" style="s2">there in annexes 6 11 and 14 of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.670" end="00:32:12.030" style="s2">aerodrome operators and the</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.500" end="00:34:42.020" style="s2">mainly on the consolidation and of these</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.849" end="00:57:26.349" style="s2">because society  it does not tolerate aviation and it has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.660" end="00:57:29.499" style="s2">safe for a long time so</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.349" end="00:57:32.079" style="s2">commercial aviation, for example, it has not achieved</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.499" end="00:57:35.470" style="s2">very high levels of safety</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.079" end="00:57:36.910" style="s2">only because it is a gesture of</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.470" end="00:57:39.700" style="s2">goodwill because it thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.910" end="00:57:41.890" style="s2">important it will do it basically because</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.700" end="00:57:44.019" style="s2">let&#39;s see with two great incentives</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.890" end="00:57:46.269" style="s2">for that  if the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.019" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">incentive occurs it is a natural incentive for</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.269" end="00:57:50.470" style="s2">any company economic incentive the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:53.519" style="s2">accident or incident is very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.470" end="00:57:55.720" style="s2">so it has become very important to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.519" end="00:57:58.900" style="s2">take care that accidents do not happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.720" end="00:58:00.380" style="s2">it is for the simple reason and for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.900" end="00:58:02.960" style="s2">simple necessity</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.380" end="00:58:06.440" style="s2">ah and not to cause damage to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.960" end="00:58:08.450" style="s2">organization company  airline and the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.440" end="00:58:09.780" style="s2">thing, in a certain way, applies to air taxis</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.780" end="00:58:15.030" style="s2">and the second fundamental incentive is what</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:17.130" style="s2">made commercial aviation</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.030" end="00:58:21.140" style="s2">so safe was</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.130" end="00:58:26.970" style="s2">society&#39;s own intolerance regarding</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.140" end="00:58:29.640" style="s2">the occurrence of the accident I don&#39;t know 40 50</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.970" end="00:58:32.010" style="s2">60 years ago  society treated it in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.640" end="00:58:35.510" style="s2">different way, along the lines of what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.010" end="00:58:38.580" style="s2">professor put it at the beginning,</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.510" end="00:58:42.150" style="s2">almost as if an accident were part of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.580" end="00:58:45.600" style="s2">fact that aircraft are flying around from time to time,</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.150" end="00:58:47.370" style="s2">it is an act</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.520" end="00:58:57.060" style="s2">aviation has become a part of people&#39;s lives</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.640" end="01:01:39.880" style="s2">and in my opinion it&#39;s this challenge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.390" end="01:01:44.920" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.880" end="01:01:49.650" style="s2">achieved when in fact it&#39;s the issue of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.920" end="01:01:55.289" style="s2">general aviation becoming a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.650" end="01:01:57.369" style="s2">strategic choice for aviation as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.289" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">in practice what i  What I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.369" end="01:02:04.210" style="s2">by this is that this will only</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:06.329" style="s2">become a reality when the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.210" end="01:02:09.369" style="s2">Brazilian state when the Brazilian government</p>

<p begin="01:02:09.369" end="01:02:19.299" style="s2">Civil Aviation Secretariat really</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.509" end="01:02:21.660" style="s2">make the decision to place this entire</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.299" end="01:02:26.109" style="s2">heterogeneous universe of general aviation</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.660" end="01:02:29.259" style="s2">as a top priority</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.109" end="01:02:32.680" style="s2">and it is like a priority of the utmost</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.259" end="01:02:37.559" style="s2">importance, based on the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.680" end="01:02:40.539" style="s2">that this base has 12 thousand aircraft, it</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.559" end="01:02:43.720" style="s2">feeds the entire Brazilian aviation system,</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.539" end="01:02:45.279" style="s2">so while this is still</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.720" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">treated in a secondary way, it</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.279" end="01:02:51.249" style="s2">seems to me that we will</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:54.309" style="s2">still remain in the field  very cool between</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.249" end="01:02:56.950" style="s2">discourse and practice and there is nothing worse</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.309" end="01:03:00.220" style="s2">for a safety culture than</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.950" end="01:03:03.700" style="s2">saying one thing sending a message</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.220" end="01:03:06.460" style="s2">to your interlocutor and practicing something</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.700" end="01:03:09.460" style="s2">completely different it is necessary to break</p>

<p begin="01:03:14.950" end="01:03:23.410" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.529" end="01:03:26.119" style="s2">main message I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.410" end="01:03:28.970" style="s2">give you and and put up for discussion here of the</p>

<p begin="01:22:28.840" end="01:22:32.770" style="s2">i think it is very continent and has a lot to</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.760" end="01:22:38.290" style="s2">do with what we talked a lot here</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.770" end="01:22:40.660" style="s2">ivan already knew i think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.290" end="01:22:42.640" style="s2">implementation of sgso there brought a</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.660" end="01:22:45.720" style="s2">possibility  for us to do something new right</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.640" end="01:22:50.100" style="s2">there within the conversations that an</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.720" end="01:22:52.720" style="s2">authority ends up taking a step back and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.100" end="01:22:54.180" style="s2">failing to prescribe in detail what</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.720" end="01:22:57.880" style="s2">an institution needs to implement</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.180" end="01:23:00.130" style="s2">and starts to rely a little more on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.880" end="01:23:03.700" style="s2">possibility of innovative solutions</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.130" end="01:23:09.430" style="s2">to mitigate a specific risk</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.700" end="01:23:11.110" style="s2">then  the idea is very positive, I understand</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.430" end="01:23:12.880" style="s2">that it has the potential to be much more</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.110" end="01:23:15.310" style="s2">effective than what we have already done.</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.880" end="01:23:18.490" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:23:15.310" end="01:23:20.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:23:18.490" end="01:23:22.810" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:23:20.800" end="01:23:26.000" style="s2">great for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.810" end="01:23:28.760" style="s2">system as a whole on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.000" end="01:23:31.060" style="s2">and it brings a difficulty that before</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.760" end="01:23:33.170" style="s2">I had a simpler job of</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.060" end="01:23:36.080" style="s2">monitoring exactly what I think I</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.170" end="01:23:37.780" style="s2">should and evaluating it is simpler is to say</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.080" end="01:23:40.720" style="s2">whether you complied or not</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.780" end="01:23:43.180" style="s2">and I pass it on  that having the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.720" end="01:23:45.430" style="s2">monitor evaluate effectiveness evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.180" end="01:23:48.280" style="s2">performance as we said this is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.430" end="01:23:49.960" style="s2">challenge for the agency, we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.280" end="01:23:51.760" style="s2">evolved in this sense of restructuring</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.960" end="01:23:54.730" style="s2">our regulations to leave a</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.760" end="01:23:57.400" style="s2">little more based on performance an</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.730" end="01:23:58.900" style="s2">example there, right, we are always a</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.400" end="01:24:01.930" style="s2">discussion  very old in brazil is what</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.900" end="01:24:03.430" style="s2">is the minimum hours for instructor and there</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.930" end="01:24:05.200" style="s2">are people who said that it has to be a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.430" end="01:24:07.390" style="s2">hours we have to be without because</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.200" end="01:24:08.590" style="s2">otherwise we will have instruction the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.390" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">like that what is important is</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.590" end="01:24:12.670" style="s2">important  the quality of the instruction</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:16.330" style="s2">so if I have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.670" end="01:24:18.640" style="s2">quality instruction builder of 300 400 500</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.330" end="01:24:22.150" style="s2">this is important here I&#39;ll evaluate if</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.640" end="01:24:23.560" style="s2">the final product is coming out positive but of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.150" end="01:24:25.600" style="s2">course it&#39;s much easier for me to go there and</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.560" end="01:24:28.990" style="s2">buy an hourly counter and say that  it has</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.600" end="01:24:30.430" style="s2">to leave there is 150 there is eh so it poses a</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.990" end="01:24:33.670" style="s2">challenge for us but it also poses a</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.430" end="01:24:35.650" style="s2">challenge for the policyholders he has to</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.670" end="01:24:37.790" style="s2">leave that position that before</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.650" end="01:24:40.460" style="s2">like this does not buy everything that the authority</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.790" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">signed up for so now I am safe</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.460" end="01:24:47.120" style="s2">and it needs to pass until it is  move in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:48.620" style="s2">sense of understanding the context analyzing</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.120" end="01:24:50.810" style="s2">the information is available for</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.620" end="01:24:55.340" style="s2">them to identify new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.810" end="01:24:57.920" style="s2">addressing a risk for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.340" end="01:25:00.380" style="s2">husband and I think that this effect that</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.920" end="01:25:02.480" style="s2">joaquim commented on is the effect of this</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.380" end="01:25:05.120" style="s2">maturation process even though we</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.480" end="01:25:07.700" style="s2">implemented a system  the system allows for</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.120" end="01:25:09.680" style="s2">an evolution a very large potential for the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.700" end="01:25:11.690" style="s2">effectiveness and for the treatment of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.680" end="01:25:13.100" style="s2">safety but it takes</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.690" end="01:25:15.170" style="s2">time to be incorporated to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.100" end="01:25:17.450" style="s2">introduced little by little both the agency</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.170" end="01:25:20.540" style="s2">and the operators are structuring</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.450" end="01:25:22.700" style="s2">and seeking to achieve this effectiveness in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.540" end="01:25:25.100" style="s2">the focus is more  prescriptive so ok</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.700" end="01:25:27.500" style="s2">your implemented the system the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.100" end="01:25:31.310" style="s2">specified it has the four</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.500" end="01:25:32.930" style="s2">components ok some time we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.310" end="01:25:34.370" style="s2">start to get into it but the details and</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.930" end="01:25:36.380" style="s2">evaluate effectiveness here you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.370" end="01:25:37.800" style="s2">monitoring your children show me</p>

<p begin="01:25:50.580" end="01:25:56.460" style="s2">they have the potential to mature and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.490" end="01:25:58.500" style="s2">idea is that everyone reaches it even if not</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.460" end="01:26:01.230" style="s2">all are at that moment  more mature</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.500" end="01:26:02.780" style="s2">the tendency that all mature people</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.230" end="01:26:05.160" style="s2">we have to do this not</p>

<p begin="01:26:05.160" end="01:26:10.620" style="s2">through this in the larger companies in the 121 with</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.040" end="01:26:12.290" style="s2">the implementation of we have viciasse</p>

<p begin="01:26:15.180" end="01:26:20.040" style="s2">implement the sujes ior and I think that  that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.730" end="01:26:21.630" style="s2">what roberto said so the focus now</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.040" end="01:26:24.300" style="s2">we know how to take these concepts</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.630" end="01:26:25.830" style="s2">is not so direct applied to general aviation</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.300" end="01:26:29.070" style="s2">but how can we take</p>

<p begin="01:27:45.360" end="01:27:49.199" style="s2">So to speak, of course I&#39;m a professor at the puc</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.639" end="01:27:51.179" style="s2">in rio grande do sul but in a way here</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.199" end="01:27:54.929" style="s2">I think I&#39;m a university student</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.179" end="01:27:57.420" style="s2">here at record, so I think there are</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.929" end="01:27:59.670" style="s2">two fundamental points, the</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.420" end="01:28:02.100" style="s2">first of which is that, of course, the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.670" end="01:28:04.290" style="s2">university is always a space</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.100" end="01:28:06.449" style="s2">like  aviation schools are spaces</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.290" end="01:28:08.310" style="s2">for training in so I think that we who</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.449" end="01:28:11.730" style="s2">have a formative role, I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.310" end="01:28:15.300" style="s2">just saying universities but</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.730" end="01:28:18.900" style="s2">aviation schools too, right, we have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.300" end="01:28:20.850" style="s2">tremendous responsibility, right in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.900" end="01:28:23.850" style="s2">of contributing to the system, my</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.850" end="01:28:26.400" style="s2">role as a teacher is  I think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.850" end="01:28:28.199" style="s2">my mission is noble is to help the</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.400" end="01:28:31.070" style="s2">Brazilian civil aviation system to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.199" end="01:28:33.389" style="s2">develop by training people who</p>

<p begin="01:28:43.840" end="01:28:48.790" style="s2">contribution universities are</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.570" end="01:28:51.580" style="s2">also spaces for research and production</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.790" end="01:28:53.550" style="s2">of knowledge and in this sense we</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.580" end="01:28:56.860" style="s2">also have a responsibility that the</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.550" end="01:29:00.970" style="s2">responsibility of helping companies,</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.860" end="01:29:04.990" style="s2">regulators, operators to leverage</p>

<p begin="01:29:14.440" end="01:29:20.410" style="s2">worldwide, where the</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.450" end="01:29:24.850" style="s2">most competitive innovation systems advance are those in</p>

<p begin="01:29:40.100" end="01:29:45.830" style="s2">and then I need airlines to</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.580" end="01:29:48.320" style="s2">be able to train my students well to</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.830" end="01:29:50.860" style="s2">develop research</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.320" end="01:29:54.740" style="s2">airlines need well-trained people</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.860" end="01:29:58.460" style="s2">obviously and also  they can benefit</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.740" end="01:30:01.280" style="s2">from knowledge and from models with</p>

<p begin="01:30:04.820" end="01:30:09.860" style="s2">obviously leverage their business, right, and in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.910" end="01:30:12.770" style="s2">same way with the regulatory authorities,</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.860" end="01:30:14.390" style="s2">so I see there is a point here we in</p>

<p begin="01:30:14.390" end="01:30:19.010" style="s2">of  Brazilian civil aviation I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:30:21.050" end="01:30:25.730" style="s2">the triple responsibility, and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.360" end="01:30:28.820" style="s2">need to at some point build</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.730" end="01:30:31.400" style="s2">this relationship better, university,</p>

<p begin="01:31:17.239" end="01:31:23.010" style="s2">he level but in fact it got more</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.369" end="01:31:26.730" style="s2">votes if you join the two questions on the</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.010" end="01:31:30.630" style="s2">same topic so if you can in your</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.730" end="01:31:33.389" style="s2">answer also say if anac has any</p>

<p begin="01:31:46.170" end="01:31:49.800" style="s2">say another question also</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.340" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">related to the implementation of margin systems.</p>

<p begin="01:32:12.380" end="01:32:17.820" style="s2">is absurd, it brings several</p>

<p begin="01:33:03.670" end="01:33:07.330" style="s2">because I think it is also in line</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.840" end="01:33:10.060" style="s2">with  that humberto talked about creating</p>
